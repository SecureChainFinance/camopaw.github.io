# Volcano Drawing Game

https://volcano.coranos.cc/

## Dates and Prizes!

The next game will be March 29th - April 5th.

The game starts and ends 4pm Chicago time, 6pm Caracas time.

The pot will be 5k ban.

Split is 25%/15%/10% then 4% for 10 finalists, and 10% split among images that get a positive score (images that are obviously vote stuffed will not be counted).

The Prizes will be influenced by the scores, but the judge has final say in which drawing gets the prizes.

## Volcano Drawing Game - How to Play!

The Volcano Drawing Game is part of banano's new volcano game, where you are rewarded for drawing well!

The rest of the Volcano Game is not done yet. You art will be a part!

We will eventually make NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) out of the best art, and introduce them as part of the game. (This part is still under construction).
